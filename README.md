# Database Management System (DBMS) Project README

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) with the following key criteria:

### 1. Database Initialization Script (5 points)

- Write a database initialization script that creates a database with a specified name and sets the database owner.

### 2. REST API Design and CRUD Implementation (15 points)

- Design a REST API architecture based on the chosen theme.
- Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### 3. Data Population Script and REST API Interaction (15 points)

- Develop a script to populate the database with a large amount of data.
- Implement a script that interacts with the REST API to add extensive data to the database.

### 4. Data Migrations (10 points)

- Create and apply at least two data migration scripts.
- Include operations like adding new columns and building indexes using migrations.

### 5. Diverse Query Types (25 points)

- Implement the following types of queries as REST API calls:
  - SELECT with multiple conditions (WHERE clause).
  - JOIN operation.
  - UPDATE with complex conditions.
  - GROUP BY operation.
  - Add sorting parameters to API queries.

### 6. JSON Field and Full-Text Search (20 points)

- Create a JSON field, populate it with data, and index it using pg_trgm + GIN.
- Implement a REST API endpoint for full-text search using regular expressions in the PostgreSQL syntax.

### 7. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Usage (10 points)

- Utilize an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for database interactions.

### 8. Pagination Implementation (10 points)

- Implement pagination in the REST API responses to handle large datasets efficiently.

### 9. Simple User Interface (UI) (10 points)

- Create a basic user interface for interacting with the database through a graphical interface.

## Execution Steps

1. **Database Initialization:**
   - Run the database initialization script.

2. **REST API:**
   - Implement the REST API following the designed architecture.

3. **Data Population:**
   - Execute the data population script to fill the database.

4. **Data Migrations:**
   - Apply data migration scripts to modify the database structure.

5. **Query Types:**
   - Test the diverse query types by making appropriate REST API calls.

6. **JSON Field and Full-Text Search:**
   - Verify JSON field creation, indexing, and full-text search functionality.

7. **ORM Usage:**
   - Confirm the usage of ORM for database interactions.

8. **Pagination:**
   - Evaluate the pagination implementation in REST API responses.

9. **User Interface:**
   - Interact with the simple user interface for a graphical representation of database operations.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a robust and feature-rich DBMS, incorporating various aspects of database management, REST API design, and user interface development. Follow the outlined steps to explore and test the functionalities of the implemented system.
